By using this Well-Architected lens you will learn best practices for building HPC workloads on AWS.


- `ML` [Machine Learning](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/wellarchitected-Machine-Learning-Lens.pdf) — This “Lens” focus on common machine learning (ML) scenarios and identify key elements to ensure that your workloads are architected according to best practices in the AWS cloud. It covers scenarios such as securing your ML datasets, architecting your ML pipelines, and best practices for cost and reliability of your ML workloads.

## <img width="21" height="21" src="images/solutions.png" /> AWS Solutions Library

The AWS Solutions Library offers a collection of cloud-based solutions for dozens of technical and business problems, vetted for you by AWS. 

- `Soltions` [Solution Collections](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/?nc1=f_cc) — AWS Solutions Implementations help you solve common problems and build faster using the AWS platform. All AWS Solutions Implementations are vetted by AWS architects and are designed to be operationally effective, reliable, secure, and cost efficient. Every AWS Solutions Implementation comes with detailed architecture, a deployment guide, and instructions for both automated and manual deployment.



## <img width="21" height="21" src="images/wa.png" /> AWS Reference Architecture Diagrams

How to architect your AWS projects...

- `collection` [Reference diagram curated collections](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/?solutions-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&solutions-all.sort-order=desc&whitepapers-main.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&whitepapers-main.sort-order=desc&reference-architecture.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&reference-architecture.sort-order=desc) — The flexibility of AWS enables you to design your application architectures the way you like. AWS Reference Architecture Diagrams provide you with the architectural guidance you need to build an application that takes full advantage of the AWS Cloud. Each diagram includes a visual representation of the application architecture and a basic description of how each service is used.



## <img width="21" height="21" src="images/builder.png" /> The Amazon Builders' Library 

The content in The Builders’ Library is written by Amazon’s senior technical leaders and engineers covering topics across architecture, software delivery, and operations. For example, readers can see how Amazon automates software delivery to achieve over 150 million deployments a year or how Amazon’s engineers implement principles such as shuffle sharding to build resilient systems that are highly available and fault tolerant.

- `The Amazon Builders' Library` [How Amazon builds and operates software](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/) — The Amazon Builders’ Library is a collection of living articles that describe how Amazon develops, architects, releases, and operates technology. 


## <img width="21" height="21" src="images/tool.png" /> AWS Well Architected Tool

The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps you review the state of your workloads and compares them to the latest AWS architectural best practices. The tool is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructure

- `Tooling` - [Well Architected Tool] (https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/) — To use this free tool, available in the AWS Management Console, just define your workload and answer a set of questions regarding operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. The AWS Well-Architected Tool then provides a plan on how to architect for the cloud using established best practices.
